# ResuMate – Your AI-Powered Resume Optimizer & Job Match Assistant
“Bridging the gap between your resume and your dream job.”

## 📘 Project Description
ResuMate is an intelligent web-based platform designed to optimize resumes, analyze skill gaps, and empower job seekers—especially students and freshers—to confidently apply for jobs that match their profiles. It compares a resume against any given job description, performs deep section-by-section analysis, detects missing or mismatched skills, and suggests actionable improvements such as projects, courses, or certifications.

The platform also includes an integrated job search and apply feature to streamline the entire process from resume enhancement to job application—all in one place.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In today’s competitive job market, job seekers often apply to multiple job openings daily, yet struggle to understand why they aren’t getting shortlisted. One of the most common issues, especially for students and freshers, is that their resume doesn’t align with the job description (JD).
Many rely on manual feedback from seniors or mentors—resources that aren't always available. This results in wasted time, missed opportunities, and low confidence.

## 🚀 The Solution: ResuMate
ResuMate solves this problem by using LLMs (Gemini by Google) to analyze resumes and JDs intelligently, highlight what’s missing, and suggest how to improve the resume before applying—maximizing the chances of getting shortlisted.

### Users can:

1. Paste or upload their resume

2. Input any job description (JD)

3. Instantly receive a detailed AI-generated analysis

4. See matched and unmatched skills

5. Get suggestions on projects and courses to bridge skill gaps

6. Download a PDF report for future reference

7. Search and apply to jobs directly from the platform

8. Track previous analysis records for learning and improvement

## 💡 Key Features

1.  Paste or Upload Resume (PDF/text supported)
